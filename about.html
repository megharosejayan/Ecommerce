									<p>We are blessed to have the opportunity to serve you by looking after physical
										fitness, mental growth, alertness, emotional sensitivity and spiritual awakening
										of your dear child.</p>

									<p>By the way formal education was not something Dr. M.A.Thomas adopted well as a
										child. His poor father, however understood the importance of a solid foundation
										of learning and insisted herre continues to study. In time... his grades
										improved as well as his appreciation for the education received. He also cleaved
										to the knowledge that the fear of the lord is the beginning of the wisdom. It is
										this principle that has guided him along very exciting pathway in life.</p>

									<p>Believing in God-given vision, he opened the first Emmanuel mission school in
										1907. From that small beginning with one school, today by the grace of God we
										are able to
										establish many Emmanuel Mission Schools in various parts of our great Nation. He
										sincerely consid profound privilege to participate in the development of our
										Nation's children. He wanted to students in Emmanuel grow beyond academic
										excellence. More importantly, Emmanuel Misston Schools also focus on spiritual,
										physical growth of each child, developing leaders tomon leaching them to serve
										their families, communities and Nation in spirit of Love.</p>

									<p>It is our desire to instill in your ward an urge for continuous quest for love,
										beauty beau: truth, faith, knowledge and justice in everyday life. But it needs
										no mention that this noble aim cannoN A achieved without your co-operation, We
										at Emmanuel value your input as a parent/guardian. 10n a better future we need
										to educate the children of today.</p>

									<p>Thank you for your interest in Emmanuel Mission School.</p>

									<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>

									<p>Emmanuel greetings!</p>
									<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to Emmanuel Mission School.
										<br> Forever 50 years
										Emmanuel has had the privilege to train many young boys and girls .Since
										teaching
										is a noble profession and calls for the qualities of head and heart; we have a
										vision to update students by providing them the best set of capabilities.</p>
									<p>Indeed, children are our heritage from God. They are precious and priceless.
										Children are as arrows in the hands of God almighty, we at Emmanuel just gather
										them, sharpen them and launch them to make a difference in the world.</p>
									<p>We believe that education requires cooperation, not competition. Learning each
										day with world through different eyes prepares our students to think about the
										future that will evolve from today. We at Emmanuel mission school believe, to
										train a child in the way he/she should
										go, and when they are old they will not turn from it. We develop students into
										leaders
										who will positively influence lives, locally,
										nationally and globally.</p>
									<p>We provide programs focusing on the all-round development of the individual with
										the emphasis on personality grooming, tolerance ability, and a strong sense of
										social and environmental responsibility. We understand that a student can find
										many friends, but not many best teachers.
										That is why we take our responsibility as teachers seriously and like to work in
										close association with the parents to know and groom the children in all aspects
										of their personality. We imbibe in our students the following traits: to live
										with honor, God fearing
										character, courage, competence, darity and confidence.</p>
									<p>The learning strategies that Emmanuel students acquire and the academic successes
										they achieve carry them beyond our campus into the future. Our faculty and staff
										are experts in the mission of guiding students for a bright
										career. We encourage our students to do one thing and that is to forget the past
										and
										press towards the goal that is set before them to win the prize for which God
										has
										made them. Everyone is a winner at Emmanuel.</p>
									<p>We at Emmanuel are always dedicated to growth and development of students.
										Everyone leaves a legacy, whether it is intentional or not. Those who are more
										intentional about it usually leave a better legacy behind. Dear students, I
										encourage you to never give up never quit It is not sufficient for
										us to be merely winners. Be a champion!</p>
									<p>God Bless you!</p>
									<p>In Emmanuel's wonderful name!<strong>&rdquo;</strong></p>

				<h2>The Significance of our school emblem</h2>
				<p>Our school Emblem is a vivid reflection of our
					organization. The name of the school Emmanuel, means "God with us". We want our students to be God
					fearing because 'He' alone is the source of true wisdom. We encourage our students to, "come forth
					to learn and go forth to serve". The child is eager to learn and we provide a healthy, loving and
					caring environment. The light in the emblem shows that true education removes the darkness and it
					also encourages to remain positive in the face of negative influences.</p>


				<p>A holistic education makes the child the epitome of goodness and humility. The book and the light in
					the emblem remind us about wonderful word of God that tells us. "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet,
					and a light unto my path".</p>


				<p>May students at Emmanuel find out that God is with them in their good times and bad times.</p>
